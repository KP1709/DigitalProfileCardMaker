## 🍼 Introduction
While learning React through Bob Ziroll's Scrimba Course (Learn React), I paid tribute to Per Borgen's Learn HTML and CSS course, his Javascript course and Fredrik Ridderfalk's Web Accessibility course by creating a customisable digital profile card. In this web application users enter their information edited on the card in real time. The way React handles forms was used as an advantage as the application constantly 'listens' for input changes. In addition, users can customise the card's colours in real time.

## 📚 Resources used

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
